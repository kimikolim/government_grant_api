## Assumptions Made

- Adding a new member to same household assumes no duplicates
- Occupation type `UNEMPLOYED` & `STUDENT` assumes income is zero
- Marital status `MARRIED` and any child in the same household assumed as children
- `SINGLE` & `DIVORCED` assumes occupant has no `spouse`
- Adding of members only allowed if a household already exists
  > Not allowed to create member without an existing valid household
- <strong>Bonus</strong>: Deletion of records are hard deletes
  > Data is not retained or stored
- <strong>Bonus</strong>: Deletion of household deletes all corresponding occupants

&nbsp;

## Improvements

- Data validation
- Unit Testing
- Modular folder restructure
- Ideally relational db eg. Postgres
- Authorisation and authentication
- Swagger API spec
